## Recoding variables

### MOCA_SERIAL1

MDAC codebook = "Now, I will ask you to count by subtracting 7 from 100, and then, keep subtracting 7 from your answer until I tell you to stop"  (1st subtraction).

This variable contains the same information as xMocaSerial7_1 in FM Pro.

```{r}

call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(xMocaSerial7_1 = MOCA_SERIAL1)

```

### MOCA_SERIAL2

MDAC codebook = "Now, I will ask you to count by subtracting 7 from 100, and then, keep subtracting 7 from your answer until I tell you to stop"  (2nd subtraction).

This variable contains the same information as xMocaSerial7_2 in FM Pro.

```{r}

call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(xMocaSerial7_2 = MOCA_SERIAL2)

```

### MOCA_SERIAL3

MDAC codebook = "Now, I will ask you to count by subtracting 7 from 100, and then, keep subtracting 7 from your answer until I tell you to stop"  (3rd subtraction).

This variable contains the same information as xMocaSerial7_3 in FM Pro.

```{r}

call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(xMocaSerial7_3 = MOCA_SERIAL3)

This variable contains the same information as xMocaSerial7_4 in FM Pro.

```{r}

call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(xMocaSerial7_4 = MOCA_SERIAL4)

```

### MOCA_SERIAL5

This variable contains similar information to MocaAbstraction in FM Pro, but includes additional response options. For this reason, it will be labeled as md_MOCA_ABSTRAC upon export to FM Pro.

### MOCA_DELREC

[NOTE: Make a check mark for each of the words correctly recalled spontaneously without any cues, in the allocated space]    FACE - VELVET - CHURCH - DAISY - RED."

Format = numeric string containing all choices correctly recalled.  e.g. "235" means Velvet, Church, and Red were correctly recalled.

This variable contains the same information as MocaDelayRecall in FM Pro.

### OR_PLACECITY

For the place, any reasonable answer should be deemed correct, e.g. my living room, my house, the store, etc.  Answers such as "on a spaceship" or "I don't know" are incorrect.  For the city, it is correct if it matches the city listed below.  Again "I don't know" is incorrect.]    Correct City:  [CITY]."

Format = numeric string containing all choices correctly recalled.  e.g. "12" means both place and city were correctly provided.

This variable contains information that will be included in MocaOrientation in FM Pro.

```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>% 
 mutate(OR_PLACECITY = recode(
   OR_PLACECITY,
   "1" = "Place",
   "2" = "City",
   "12" = "Place,City",
   "21" = "Place,City"
  )
)
```

### MocaOrientation

The "MocaOrientation" variable shown in the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet requires combining the results of variables "OR_DATE", "OR_DAY", and "OR_PLACECITY". "MocaOrientation" should be formatted as a character string using a combination of the words "Date", "Month", "Year", "Day", "Place", and "City", depending on the participant's success during the corresponding assessment.

To create "MocaOrientation", we can first alter the "OR_DATE" variable to display the word "Date" for participants who were successful in the assessment corresponding to "OR_DATE", "Year" for participants who stated the correct year, and "Month: for participants who stated the correct month.


```{r}
# Separating OR_DATE into year, month, and day columns

OR_DATE_separated <- t(sapply(call_history$OR_DATE, function(x) substring(x, first=c(1,5,7), last=c(4,6,8))))


# Binding the new columns created in the matrix above to the call_history dataset

call_history <- cbind(call_history, OR_DATE_separated)


# Renaming the new columns

call_history <- rename(call_history, ORD_year = "1")
call_history <- rename(call_history, ORD_month = "2")
call_history <- rename(call_history, ORD_day = "3")


# Separating ResLastCallDate into year, month, and day columns

ResLastCallDate_separated <- t(sapply(call_history$ResLastCallDate, function(x) substring(x, first=c(1,5,7), last=c(4,6,8))))


# Binding the new columns created in the matrix above to the call_history dataset

call_history <- cbind(call_history, ResLastCallDate_separated)


# Renaming the new columns

call_history <- rename(call_history, RLCD_year = "1")
call_history <- rename(call_history, RLCD_month = "2")
call_history <- rename(call_history, RLCD_day = "3")


# Converting each variable to character and then to numeric

call_history$ORD_year <- as.character(call_history$ORD_year)
call_history$ORD_year <- as.numeric(call_history$ORD_year)
call_history$ORD_month <- as.character(call_history$ORD_month)
call_history$ORD_month <- as.numeric(call_history$ORD_month)
call_history$ORD_day <- as.character(call_history$ORD_day)
call_history$ORD_day <- as.numeric(call_history$ORD_day)

call_history$RLCD_year <- as.character(call_history$RLCD_year)
call_history$RLCD_year <- as.numeric(call_history$RLCD_year)
call_history$RLCD_month <- as.character(call_history$RLCD_month)
call_history$RLCD_month <- as.numeric(call_history$RLCD_month)
call_history$RLCD_day <- as.character(call_history$RLCD_day)
call_history$RLCD_day <- as.numeric(call_history$RLCD_day)


# Creating difference variables to determine if the individual got the date, year, and/or month correct

call_history <- call_history %>% 
 mutate(OR_DATE_datediff = (RLCD_day-ORD_day)) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DATE_date = case_when(OR_DATE_datediff == 0~'Date')) %>%
  mutate(OR_DATE_yeardiff = (RLCD_year-ORD_year)) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DATE_year = case_when(OR_DATE_yeardiff == 0~'Year')) %>%
  mutate(OR_DATE_monthdiff = (RLCD_month-ORD_month)) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DATE_month = case_when(OR_DATE_monthdiff == 0~'Month'))

```

Next, we can alter the "OR_DAY" variable to display the word "Day" for participants who were successful in the assessment corresponding to "OR_DAY". We can do this by:

1. Putting the "ResLastCallDate" into the Year/Month/Day format.

2. Creating a variable called "weekday" and filling it with the names of the weekdays corresponding to the dates in "ResLastCallDate".

3. Recoding "weekday" to match the formatting of the variable "OR_DAY". [Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3, Wednesday = 4, Thursday = 5, Friday = 6, Saturday = 7]

4. Recoding "OR_DAY" to display to display the word "Day" if the numeric value in the "OR_DAY" variable was equal to the numeric value in the "weekday" variable.

```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>% 
 mutate(ResLastCallDate = ymd(ResLastCallDate)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ResLastCallDate)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = recode(
    weekday,
    "Sunday" = "1",
    "Monday" = "2",
    "Tuesday" = "3",
    "Wednesday" = "4",
    "Thursday" = "5",
    "Friday" = "6",
    "Saturday" = "7")) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DAY = case_when(weekday == OR_DAY~"Day"
  )
)
```

Now we can create the "MocaOrientation" variable by combining "OR_DATE_date", "OR_DATE_year", "OR_DATE_month", "OR_DAY", and "OR_PLACECITY".

```{r}
call_history$MocaOrientation = paste(
  call_history$OR_DATE_date,
  call_history$OR_DATE_year,
  call_history$OR_DATE_month,
  call_history$OR_DAY,
  call_history$OR_PLACECITY,
  sep = ","
)
```

## Grouping variables

Pulling the original FileMaker variables to their respective M Davis groupings (PhoneRecruitment, CallLog, and ParticipantScheduler) based on the expected file format laid out in the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet.

Note: the Phone Recruitment data frame requires only the most recent call attempt to be included.
